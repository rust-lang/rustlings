First hint: To figure out what type should go where the ??? is, take a look

Next hint: There are three places in `read_and_validate` that we call a
function that returns a `Result` (that is, the functions might fail).
Apply the `?` operator on those calls so that we return immediately from
`read_and_validate` if those function calls fail.


Another hint: under the hood, the `?` operator calls `From::from`
on the error value to convert it to a boxed trait object, a Box<dyn error::Error>,
which is polymorphic-- that means that lots of different kinds of errors
can be returned from the same function because all errors act the same
since they all implement the `error::Error` trait.
Check out this section of the book:

Another another hint: Note that because the `?` operator returns
the *unwrapped* value in the `Ok` case, if we want to return a `Result` from
`read_and_validate` for *its* success case, we'll have to rewrap a value
that we got from the return value of a `?`ed call in an `Ok`-- this will
look like `Ok(something)`.
