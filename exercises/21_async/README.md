# Async

Rust includes built-in support for asynchronous programming. In other languages, this might be known as Promises or
Coroutines. async programming uses async functions, which are powerful, but may require some getting used to,
especially if you haven't used something similar in another language.

The [relevant book chapter][1] is essential reading. The [tokio docs][2] are also very helpful!
