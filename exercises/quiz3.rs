// This quiz tests:
// - Generics
// - Traits
//
// An imaginary magical school has a new report card generation system written
// in Rust! Currently the system only supports creating report cards where the
// student's grade is represented numerically (e.g. 1.0 -> 5.5). However, the
// school also issues alphabetical grades (A+ -> F-) and needs to be able to
// print both types of report card!
//
// Make the necessary code changes in the struct ReportCard and the impl block
// to support alphabetical report cards. Change the Grade in the second test to
// "A+" to show that your changes allow alphabetical grades.
//
// Execute `rustlings hint quiz3` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.
