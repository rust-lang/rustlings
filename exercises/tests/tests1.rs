// Tests are important to ensure that your code does what you think it should
// do. Tests can be run on this file with the following command: rustlings run
// tests1
//
// This test has a problem with it -- make the test compile! Make the test pass!
// Make the test fail!
//
// Execute `rustlings hint tests1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.

        assert!(true, "it's true");
