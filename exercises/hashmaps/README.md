# Hashmaps

A _hash map_ allows you to associate a value with a particular key.
You may also know this by the names [_unordered map_ in C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map),
[_dictionary_ in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) or an _associative array_
in other languages.

This is the other data structure that we've been talking about before, when
talking about Vecs.
