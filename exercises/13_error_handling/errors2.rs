// errors2.rs
//
// Say we're writing a game where you can buy items with tokens. All items cost
// 5 tokens, and whenever you purchase items there is a processing fee of 1
// token. A player of the game will type in how many items they want to buy, and
// the `total_cost` function will calculate the total cost of the items. Since
// the player typed in the quantity, though, we get it as a string-- and they
// might have typed anything, not just numbers!
//
// Right now, this function isn't handling the error case at all (and isn't
// handling the success case properly either). What we want to do is: if we call
// the `total_cost` function on a string that is not a number, that function
// will return a `ParseIntError`, and in that case, we want to immediately
// return that error from our function and not try to multiply and add.
//
// There are at least two ways to implement this that are both correct-- but one
// is a lot shorter!
//
// Execute `rustlings hint errors2` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.
