// We're collecting different fruits to bake a delicious fruit cake. For this,

// represents the name of each fruit we collect and the value represents how
// many of that particular fruit we have collected. Three types of fruits -
// Apple (4), Mango (2) and Lychee (5) are already in the basket hash map. You
// must add fruit to the basket so that there is at least one of each kind and
// more than 11 in total - we have a lot of mouths to feed. You are not allowed
// to insert any more of the fruits that are already in the basket (Apple,
// Mango, and Lychee).
