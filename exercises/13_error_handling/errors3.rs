// This is a program that is trying to use a completed version of the
// `total_cost` function from the previous exercise. It's not working though!
// Why not? What should we do to fix it?

// Execute `rustlings hint errors3` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.

// I could have just returned the ParseIntError from the total_cost function
// because we know the exact error that's being returned.

    // Meaning, you would use this when you know an error can be returned but 
    // not necessarily what kind
