// The compiler message is saying that Rust cannot infer the type that the
// variable binding `x` has with what is given here.
// What happens if you annotate line 5 with a type annotation?
// What if you give x a value?
// What if you do both?
// What type should x be, anyway?
// What if x is the same type as 10? What if it's a different type?
