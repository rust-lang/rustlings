// There's a shorthand to initialize Arrays with a certain size that does not 
// require you to type in 100 items (but you certainly can if you want!).
// For example, you can do:
// let array = ["Are we there yet?"; 10];

// Bonus: what are some other things you could have that would return true
// for `a.len() >= 100`?
