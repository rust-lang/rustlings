# Error handling

Most errors aren’t serious enough to require the program to stop entirely.
Sometimes, when a function fails, it’s for a reason that you can easily interpret and respond to.
For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.
