Step 1
The variable `first` is a `char`. It needs to be capitalized and added to the
remaining characters in `c` in order to return the correct `String`.
The remaining characters in `c` can be viewed as a string slice using the
`as_str` method.
The documentation for `char` contains many useful methods.
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html

Step 2
Create an iterator from the slice. Transform the iterated values by applying
the `capitalize_first` function. Remember to collect the iterator.

Step 3.
This is surprising similar to the previous solution. Collect is very powerful
and very general. Rust just needs to know the desired type."""

`Arc` is an Atomic Reference Counted pointer that allows safe, shared access
to **immutable** data. But we want to *change* the number of `jobs_completed`
so we'll need to also use another type that will only allow one thread to
mutate the data at a time. Take a look at this section of the book:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-03-shared-state.html#atomic-reference-counting-with-arct
and keep reading if you'd like more hints :)


Do you now have an `Arc` `Mutex` `JobStatus` at the beginning of main? Like:
`let status = Arc::new(Mutex::new(JobStatus { jobs_completed: 0 }));`
Similar to the code in the example in the book that happens after the text
that says "We can use Arc<T> to fix this.". If not, give that a try! If you
do and would like more hints, keep reading!!


Make sure neither of your threads are holding onto the lock of the mutex
while they are sleeping, since this will prevent the other thread from
being allowed to get the lock. Locks are automatically released when
they go out of scope.

Ok, so, real talk, this was actually tricky for *me* to do too. And
I could see a lot of different problems you might run into, so at this
point I'm not sure which one you've hit :)

these hints are not helping you with, or if you've looked at the sample
answers and don't understand why they work and yours doesn't.
